    time: "6:30 Pm"
    title: "Functionally Functional Programming - Part 1"
    subtitle: "Functional programming is a technique of programming that promises to deal with ever growing complexity of software. Most main stream programming languages seem to push tenets of FP - be it functions as first class values, or immutability. In this talk, I'd like to introduce FP using examples in Haskell, Clojure and Nim and hopefully get folks excited by it."
