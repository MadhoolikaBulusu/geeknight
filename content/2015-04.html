    title: "CI and CD"
    subtitle: "Being agile provides various interesting challenges for the teams adopting Agile methodologies. One of the key differentiators of Agile from traditional methodologies is the quick feedback cycle which includes frequent releases which has its own set of considerations. Continuous Integration(CI) and Continuous Delivery(CD) are a set of practices, patterns and tools that will help teams to deal with unique challenges that they face with frequent releases. This talk will concentrate on helping teams to adopt CI/CD and make it an enabler and not be a blocker in their journey to be Agile."
