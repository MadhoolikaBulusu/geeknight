subheader: "<b>Practical Functional Programming</b>"
subnote: "From crunching millions of petabytes to scaling to hundreds of servers, Functional Programming drives it all. Mutexes, semaphores and locks are things of past and just functions are the solutions themselves. This is about making simple easy, tackling complexity with simplicity and taking a step backwards instead of forward so that the problem is much clear."
