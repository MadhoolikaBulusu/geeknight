    subtitle: "
            <h6>When we solve the same problems over and over again, we realize that we can standardize on solutions. Over a period of time, these solutions are accepted by a larger group of developers.These solutions evolve into patterns.</h6>
            <br>
            <h6>Patterns range from those associated with high-level architectural problems to those which apply to specific pieces of software. In any case, no design pattern exists in isolation. Often, we find ourselves presented with a complex problem that can benefit from the application of multiple design patterns.</h6>
            <br>
            <h6><b>In this tech talk, we will see the fundamental guiding principles for choosing and using patterns. We will cover the 5 principles of Uncle Bob, which are a must-know for every developer.</b></h6>
            <br>
            <h6>We will also solve specific problems which fit within the following categories.</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>managing layers of software</li>
                <li>creating pipelines for data processing</li>
                <li>dealing with user input</li>
                <li>maintaining complex business rules</li>
                <li>dealing with class hierarchies</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>In the solution to above problems, we will encounter around 8-10 design patterns that are most widely used. Below are the design patterns which will be covered in this talk.</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Builder</li>
                <li>Command</li>
                <li>Composite</li>
                <li>Decorator</li>
                <li>Event-Observer</li>
                <li>Factory</li>
                <li>Specification</li>
                <li>Strategy</li>
                <li>Visitor</li>
